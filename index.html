    <p>Coming out of my cage
        And I've been doing just fine
        Gotta gotta be down
        Because I want it all
        It started out with a kiss
        How did it end up like this?
        <b>It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss</b>
        Now I'm falling asleep
        And she's calling a cab
        While he's having a smoke
        And she's taking a drag
        Now they're going to bed
        And my stomach is sick
        And it's all in my head
        But she's touching his chest now
        He takes off her dress now
        Let me go
        And I just can't look, it's killing me
        And taking control</p>
